          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Household Income, Age and Obesity</h2>
          </br>
          
          <h4>A Look At Household Income And Poverty vs. Obesity</h4>          
          <p>Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by income or education, although patterns might differ in high and low income countries.
          Analysis of data from the 2011–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examining the association between obesity 
          and education and obesity and income among U.S. adults demonstrate that obesity prevalence patterns by income vary between women and 
          men and by race/Hispanic origin. The prevalence of obesity decreased with increasing income in women (from 45.2% to 29.7%), 
          but there was no difference in obesity prevalence between the lowest (31.5%) and highest (32.6%) income groups among men. 
          Moreover, obesity prevalence was lower among college graduates than among persons with less education for non-Hispanic white 
          women and men, non-Hispanic black women, and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic Asian women and men or non-Hispanic black or Hispanic men. 
          The association between obesity and income or educational level is complex and differs by sex, and race/non-Hispanic origin</p>

          <h4>How Does Age Change The Facts?</h4>
          <p>All estimates were adjusted to account for the complex survey design, including examination sample weights. Estimates were age-adjusted to the 2000 projected U.S. 
          Census population using the age groups 20–39, 40–59, and over 60 years. Confidence intervals for estimates were calculated using the Wald method. 
          Differences between income and education groups were tested using a two-sided, univariate t-statistic, with statistical significance defined as a p-value of
           less than 0.05. Temporal trends from 1999–2002 to 2011–2014 were analyzed using orthogonal contrasts and 2-year survey cycles. 
           Pregnant women (122) and participants with missing weight or height (571) were excluded, resulting in a total sample 
           size of 10,636 for the period 2011–2014. For estimates by FPL, an additional 851 participants were excluded because of missing FPL 
           data, and for estimates by education, eight participants were excluded because information on education was missing.</p>
